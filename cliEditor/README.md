# Cli Editor

## WIP: No Prototype Yet.

A cli-based editor for making question sets. Shouldn't be extremely necessary due to the nature of the format, but might be nicer.

## Language

I am debating on making this in the following languages:

- NodeJS
  - Pros:
    - I am familiar with Javascript and could write it quickly and in an extendable way.
  - Cons:
    - Speed
    - Nodejs requirement or pkg the v8 runtime.
- Rust
  - Pros:
    - Speed
    - Safety
    - I am somewhat familiar with Rust, and could write it semi-quickly, but I do not know how extendable it would be.
  - Cons:
    - Slower development
    - Different language than the webapp.
- Bash
  - Pros:
    - Easy to write initially
    - Small, compressible file
    - Runs on any _linux_ or _mac_ system. (WSL for Windows)
  - Cons:
    - Shell language can be difficult to create an extensible system for.
