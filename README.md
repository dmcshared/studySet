# Open Study App

The intent of this project is to create an open source decentralized study system by using JSON study sets.

## Structure

- The study set schema (and user status schemas) are defined in the schema directory. Please contribute any question types you would like to add.
- TODO: The CLI Set editor is in the cliEditor folder. I may make this in rust or nodejs, but it currently does not exist.
- TODO: The WebApp is in the webApp folder. It is mobile-first and will have minimal testing done on computer. (Likely just adding large margins to all sides) It will be made statically and deployed to github pages.

## Contribution

- Make an issue and optionally a PR if you want to contribute. Generally try not to include any foul language or private information on the github.
